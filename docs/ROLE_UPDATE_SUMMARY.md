## Route Protection

All routes are now protected with appropriate role guards:
- Routes requiring full HR access: `['hr-manager']`
- Routes for senior operations: `['hr-assistant-senior', 'hr-manager']`
- Routes for basic operations: `['hr-assistant-junior', 'hr-assistant-senior', 'hr-manager']`
- Personal/employee routes: `['site-admin']`

## Default Users Created (Backend)
1. **HR Manager**: hrmanager@hrms.com
2. **HR Assistant Junior**: hrassistant.junior@hrms.com  
3. **HR Assistant Senior**: hrassistant.senior@hrms.com
4. **Site Admin**: siteadmin@hrms.com

All default accounts use password: `password` (should be changed in production)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test login with each role type
2. Verify dashboard access and redirection
3. Check menu visibility based on role permissions
4. Test route protection and unauthorized access handling
5. Verify permission-based feature access
6. Test role hierarchy and access escalation

## Notes

- All permissions follow the backend structure using dot notation (e.g., `module.action`)
- Role hierarchy ensures higher roles can access lower role functions
- Menu system automatically filters based on user permissions
- Dashboard components are role-specific with relevant widgets and actions
- Modal components provide quick access to role-appropriate functions

## Future Considerations

- Consider implementing permission caching for performance
- Add role-based UI theming
- Implement granular feature toggling within modules
- Add audit logging for role-based actions
- Consider role delegation or temporary access features
