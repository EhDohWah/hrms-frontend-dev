● The error is clear — the <a-select> component is receiving an array of plain
  strings (['Select', 'Medical Leave', ...]) instead of objects ([{ value: 
  '...', label: '...' }]). Let me find the component.

● Searched for 4 patterns, read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Found it. The Leavetype is an array of strings, but <a-select :options> needs
  an array of objects. Let me also check the other selects in this component.

● Searched for 1 pattern (ctrl+o to expand)

● All three arrays (Leavetype, Addemployee, Addemp) are plain string arrays.
  They all need to be converted to { value, label } objects. Let me fix the data
   definition.

● The fix is applied. The issue was that <a-select :options> in Ant Design Vue
  requires an array of { value, label } objects, but the component was passing
  plain string arrays like ["Select", "Medical Leave", ...]. This caused the
  Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'options' in Select error because Ant
  Design tries to access properties on each option item, and strings don't have
  those properties.

  The three data arrays (Leavetype, Addemployee, Addemp) have been converted
  from plain strings to { value, label } objects. This should fix both the
  render error and the navigation freeze (the unhandled error was crashing Vue's
   reactivity system, which blocked further navigation).
